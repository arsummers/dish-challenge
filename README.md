# dish-challenge

## Project goals
Create a django-backed webpage emulating a given food delivery menu, and have the ability to take a "screenshot" of the page to send as an mms.

Built using Django, styled using CSS grid.

Deployed site: https://as-dishes-challenge.herokuapp.com/

## Dependencies
- Imgkit
- wkhtmltopdf (outside installation)
- dj-databse-url
- Django
- gunicorn
- pillow
- psycopg2-binary (for postgres database)
- whitenoise (for handling deployed static files)

### To run locally:
- `git clone` this repository
- run `pipenv install` to download dependencies
- run `pipenv shell` to access the virtual environment and use the dependencies
- to run start the server:

...run `python manage.py runserver`, then navigate to localhost:8000. You may also have to run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.

- to take an image of the deployed site:

...run `python food_imgkit.py`. This will output an image titled `dishmms.jpg` directly into the root of your local clone.

### A quick note about Imgkit, wkhtmltopdf, and the "screenshot"
You'll quickly notice that the output image has a different layout from the hosted site. This is because wkhtmltopdf does not support CSS grid or flexbox layouts. This is a known issue (source [here](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/issues/3661)). To get around this, the layout would need to be rewritten using floats, which isn't feasible given the time constraints of this project. Other CSS elements have been preserved.
